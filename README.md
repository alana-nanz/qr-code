## My process

- After downloading the starter code and setting up my files, I started by writing the html. 
- After finishing the html, I started writing my base css styles using the style guide. I then wrote CSS for the container and divs and used flexbox to center everything on the page.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I used border-radius to round the edges:
```css
.container {
  border-radius: 10px;
}
```

-I used display.flex on the main and figure sections to center the content:
```css
figure {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

- I plan to continue learning about flexbox properties. 
- I want to better understand when and when not to give content widths and heights for responsive design.

### Useful resources

- https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_borders.asp - This helped me learn about rounded edges.
